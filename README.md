# Aspiring Vanguard Roll Sheet App
A small app to make it easier for my RP guildmates to make their character stat sheets.

The app currently consists of two Forms, or pages, frist one for allocating stat points and the second for describing perks. It can also write the stats and perks to a .txt file and saves that in C:\Users\Public 

The app is made in Visual studio 2015 with Visual C#
